               <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
               <p>Hey there, welcome to our spot on the web where we're diving deep into the issue of diversity in the
                    IT world!
                    Over the past few years, information technology has exploded, becoming a major force driving
                    innovation and change.
                    <br><br>
                    But here's the thing: even though women and folks of color have been rocking it in IT, there's still
                    a big lack of diversity in many areas.
                    This lack of diversity isn't just a bummer for the individuals who aren't represented—it's a big
                    deal for the whole industry.
                    <br><br>
                    That's why our website is here! We're all about sharing info and resources on this super important
                    topic.
                    Plus, we want to get the conversation going and spur some action towards making the IT world a more
                    diverse and inclusive place.
                    <br><br>
                    So, take a look around, dive into the discussions, and let's team up to make the future of IT fairer
                    and more awesome for everyone.
                    Glad to have you here!

               <h2>CURRENT DAY</h2>
               <p>Here are some current problems that people face everyday:
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Limited Perspectives:</b> When everyone in a certain profession comes from similar backgrounds, they might not think of all the different ways people might use technology.
                    This means we could miss out on cool new ideas and inventions that could help everyone.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Bias in Technology:</b> Ever heard the saying "garbage in, garbage out"? Well, it's true for tech too!
                    Sometimes, the people who make technology don't think about everyone who might use it.
                    For example, facial recognition software might not work as well for people with darker skin tones, which could lead to some pretty bad situations.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Underrepresentation of Customers:</b> If the people making tech don't look like the people using it, they might not make stuff that works for everyone.
                    This means some people could miss out on cool tech that could make their lives easier.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Limited Opportunities:</b> When there's not enough diversity in the IT world, it's harder for people from different backgrounds to get in on the action.
                    That means some really smart and talented people might not get the chance to shine.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Negative Impacts on Society:</b> Tech has a huge impact on how we live our lives, and when it's not made with everyone in mind, it can make things worse.
                    Biased tech can make unfairness and inequality even worse in our society.
                    To fix these problems, we need to make sure the IT world looks more like the real world.
                    That means doing things like training people on diversity and inclusion, reaching out to groups that don't have as much representation, and making workplaces more welcoming to everyone.
                    When we have more diversity in the IT world, we can make tech that works better for everyone and helps make the world a fairer place.
